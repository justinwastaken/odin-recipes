        <li>2 tsp salt, plus more for salting water</li>
        <li>½ tsp cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 (28-oz) cans whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 (6-oz) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 lb Spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground sirloin, bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan, salt, pepper, and beaten egg. Mix well to combine the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Form the meat mixture into 12 ping-pong size balls. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place a large Dutch oven over medium heat. When the pot is hot, add the meatballs, being careful not to crowd them.</li>
        <li>Cook for 7 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally, until browned. Using a slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to a plate. Discard the grease in the pot.</li>
        <li>Return the pot to medium heat and add the olive oil. Swirl the pot to coat the bottom completely.</li>
        <li>Once the pot is hot, add the onion and garlic. Sauté for 4 to 5 minutes until the onion is translucent. Stir in the tomatoes, sugar, and bay leaf. Taste and adjust the salt, as needed. Cover the pot and turn the heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste. Add the meatballs. Return the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pot and cook for 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>While the sauce cooks, bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta. Cook until al dente, about 1 minute less than package directions.</li>
        <li>Drain spaghetti and add it to the pot with the meatballs and sauce. Gently stir to coat the pasta in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve the spaghetti and meatballs with a side of garlic bread, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
